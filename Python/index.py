# is to comment out in .py
# print('hello world')
# Strings in py are either single or double quotes.
# .Py variables can't have spaces or symbols other than underscore, can't begin with a number but can have numbers after the first letter. ie. cool_variable_5
# .Py error denoted with ^character. Syntax Error: punctuation, command where it is not expected or missing parenthesis
# NameError: .Py sees a word it doesn't recognize || code contains something that looks like a variable but was never defined.
# Numbers : same as Java so far int = whole num; float = float ie. an_int = 2 a_float = 2.5 print(an_int + 4)
# Calculations: diff: .Py division .Py converts int to float before performing division. .Py will throw special error: zeroDivisionError when dividing by zero
# Pemdas/ Exponents .Py num ** numE = exponents
# mod = same, concate same except: str(num) to add into string if not used an integer
# Example: myAge + str(age)
# Triple quote = multi-line string
# Example: multStr = ''' blah blah '''
# .Py basics part one, I will learn .Py later
# const byePy = later => javascript;
